This is a mini application to visualize a github repository statistics in a chronological graph.

Bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Fork and clone this project to your local.

After that, create an `env.local` file in your local repository at the same level as `package.json`. You can follow the model in the `env.local.example` file to see which data are needed.

Lastly, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to open the apps.
